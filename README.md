# Welcome to My Dev Space! :wave:

Hello there, fellow coder! :computer: I'm a polyglot programmer fluent in Python :snake:, JavaScript :yellow_heart:, R :bar_chart:, SQL: 💾 and React.js :atom_symbol:. Here's where I build, break, and fix stuff - sometimes all at once.

## About Me :man_technologist:
Coding's my interest—I'm all about writing clean, effective code with a dash of style. When I'm not in the zone with code, I'm either tackling machine learning/deep learning puzzles or playing around with the latest in website tech.

- 📊 **Data Enthusiast**: I love turning numbers into graphs.
- 🖥️ **Full-Stack Developer**: From back to front, I make sure everything functions seamlessly.
- 🎨 **Creative Coder**: I believe in code that not only works but is also a joy to read.

## Featured Projects :star2:
